## Development

The site uses static HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. There is no build step.

```powershell
python -m http.server 4174 --directory public
```

Open `http://localhost:4174` after starting the server. Note that this serves
files literally: `vercel.json` owns `cleanUrls`, the redirects and the security
headers, so `/about` 404s locally while `/about.html` works. Use `vercel dev`
when routing or headers are what you are testing.

## Resume

`resume/resume.tex` is the source; `public/resume.pdf` is generated from it and
is never edited by hand.

```bash
cd resume && pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error resume.tex
cp resume.pdf ../public/resume.pdf
```

`resume/README.md` carries the checks that matter before sending it anywhere.

## Structure

## Deployment

Vercel serves `public/` and deploys `main` automatically. Redirects in
`vercel.json` consolidate the former Architect of Silence domain under
`alkindix.com`.

See [`docs/`](docs/) for architecture, content, design, and deployment notes.
